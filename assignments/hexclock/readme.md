# Hexclock

## Description

Everyone needs to be able to tell time. Also, it's really fun to confuse
people. How about we kill two birds with one stone? Let's make a clock that
tells the time in hex (base 16).

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives (Front End)

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Be more familiar with the DOM
* Be able to do basic math
* Understand basic string manipulation
* Understand functions (at a basic level)
* Understand the JavaScript Date object


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively...

* Be able to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamically updated page
* Deploy pages to GitHub


## Details

### Deliverables

* A GitHub project called "hexclock"
* A working clock that displays time in hexadecimal
* The clock should be hosted in GitHub pages

## Normal Mode (MVP)

* Create a page that displays the current time in hexadecimal (base 16).
* For example, if it is 3:17 PM (and 8 seconds), the clock would show 0F:11:08
* The clock should update smoothly (no jumpiness)
* The page title should also display the current time
* Color should transition smoothly, not suddenly
* The page's body's background color should be computed based on the time

## Hard Mode

* Display time in base 2 (binary 001100:111011:001000)
* Note that values should always display 8 digits, left-padded with zeros
* Color should still change as in normal mode
