## Exercise

Create a blog layout. Blog posts have a header, multiple paragraphs, and
an image or two. (You can download some from [pexels](http://www.pexels.com/).)
Content should be centered on screen, but text should be left-aligned.

Play with color, if you want: [here's a color guide from Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette)

Remember:

- line-length should not exceed 70 characters
- line-height should be proportional to the font-size
- blocks should have extra space (usually a blank line) between them
