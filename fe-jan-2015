# Front-end Engineering - Jan 2015

Oh, hi. Welcome to the 2015 front-end engineering class. There will be lots of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and caffeine. It's going to be swell.

I've put together a list of things that you can do in order to prep for class. If you get stuck, don't sweat it. We'll be covering all of this in class.

## Set Up Your Workstation

* Get a Mac
* Learn a bit about the terminal, especially the commands: ls, cd, mkdir, and pwd
  * http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics
  * http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
* Learn ye some git
  * Download it here: http://git-scm.com/download/mac
  * Learn about it here: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
* Install Atom
  * [Download Atom](https://atom.io/) a code-editor
  * Install and run it.
  * Run Atom > Install Shell Commands.
* Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* Sign up for (GitHub)[https://github.com]


## Tinker With Some Tech

The following is *definitely* not required before starting class, but if you get familiar with it, you will have an easier time in your first few weeks.

### Learn HTML

There are two ways to start, and which one is "right" depends on how you learn.

If you like to read a bit first, and then tinker, I'd start here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction

If you like to tinker first, and then read, I'd start at Codepen. But first a warning! Codepen HTML snippets are not full HTML documents. Codepen generates the HTML document based on what you type. You are only typing the HTML body content, which is a really good place to start.

OK. So, what do you type in the Codepen window? Have a look at the HTML elements listed here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

Try typing them into the codepen window and seeing what happens.

If you're confused about an element, Google about it, and keep tinkering.

Here's a more in-depth set of resources:

### Learn Basic CSS

There are lots of CSS tutorials out there. They'll probably teach you pretty bad practices, so I'd recommend sticking to the basics.

Here is a *good* resource:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/What_is_CSS

MDN is generally about as good a resource as you can find online (for free, anyway).

Play around with CSS here:

Take a look at some of these sites, and find designs that you like:

http://www.awwwards.com/

http://psddd.co/

Then, try implementing something similar, just as a learning exercise.

## The End

If you've gotten this far, good job. Take a break. The cohort is going to be a lot of work, but hopefully also a lot of fun.
